## Data Flow

1. The user at client side sends a request to the application through the API endpoints.
2. The API receives the request and sends it to the appropriate controller method.
3. The controller method makes a call to the method in service class.
4. The method in service class builds logic and retrieves or modifies data from the database, which is in turn given to controller class
5. The controller method returns a response to the API.
6. The API sends the response back to the user.
